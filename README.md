This project focuses on building an AI-driven phishing webpage detection system that leverages machine learning to identify malicious sites based on URL structure, webpage content, and external domain features. Using well-established datasets from Mendeley and Kaggle, the model aims to accurately classify phishing versus legitimate pages while incorporating explainability tools such as SHAP and LIME to provide clear insights into prediction behavior. The project is designed to be both practical and educational, showcasing core ML concepts—including feature engineering, model evaluation, and handling real-world generalization challenges—with the option to extend the work into a lightweight web demo for real-time detection.
